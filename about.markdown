    body: Hello, we’re NARI, a design practice established to put character back in
      creativity, placing people and play at the forefront of what we do.
      Through this mindful approach, we bring humanity and personality to the
      commercial landscape while defining critical expertise within artistic
      spaces.
  - title: Approach
    body: >-
      Fundamentally led by our namesake (Not Always Right Ideas), we use our
      mantra to push people and projects into unexpected new directions,
      grounded by an expertise defined by challenging ideas and daring to go
      where others dare not. Together, we pilot our clients down paths that are
      similarly anti-prescriptive and adventurous—crafting ideas and aesthetics
      that set new artistic standards.\

      \

      At NARI, we are as proud of our imperfect expression as we are powered by strategic thinking, founding the work we do with branding and psychological theory before the pen touches the page. Collaborative at our core, we work alongside our expansive NARI network of multi-disciplinary specialists, ensuring that each and every project is uniquely tailored to its specific needs.
