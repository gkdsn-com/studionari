  - title: Studio
    body: We're NARI. A creative practice and branding studio, established to bridge
      the gap between design and art. This is encapsulated by our acronymised
      mantra - Not Always ‘*Right*’ Ideas - and is at the core of everything we
      do. Drawing the focus away from the ‘do’s & dont’s’ of textbook graphic
      design and allowing us to practice a humanistic and artistic approach.
  - title: Approach
    body: >-
      Art x Science - We combine artistic practice with branding, strategic and
      psychological theory. This allows us to ensure any outcome is grounded in
      truth, yet transmits those all-important humanistic and artistic values. 


      Our extended family - Something we pride ourself on is building bespoke teams for every project from our growing network of multi-disciplinary creatives. This ensures we have the right people on the right job and teams comprising of the most talented creatives in the industry


      The best ideas come from conversations **\-** Whether it be in the form of workshops with our clients or internal sprints within our team, we try and structure our projects in a way that we can have as many of these moments as possible.
