    textOne: "## We teamed up with typographer Margot Levique and partnered with
      designer Kusheda Mensah, to create visual identity for her highly revered
      furniture design studio, Modular by Mensah. As the name would suggest,
      Mensah’s artistic remedy comes in the form of her interlocking modular
      pieces of furniture, providing a fun yet considered take on functional
      living environments."

    textOne: "## It would be remiss if our concept for the core identity didn't riff
      off Kusheda’s overarching focus for her furniture design, *‘Modularity’*
      but we also ensured the graphic language took heed from what inspired her
      as a designer; *“the connection and closeness shared between humans, as
      well as the human form itself”.* The set of glyph vowels in the logotype
      reflected this sentiment, acting as the *‘human’* connection between the
      modular consonants."
