    textOne: "## We partnered with Nike and world champion paralympic fencer, Bebe
      Vio, to create an identity for her Academy; an inclusive program focused
      on Bebe’s vision - making sport accessible to all. This project was in
      collaboration with Nike for their ‘PassBack’ program, an initiative that
      partners with athletes in order to catalyse positive change."

    textOne: "## Our concept ‘One Team’ is based upon the core values and virtues
      needed for a team to succeed - support, community and bravery. This was
      communicated in the crest-esque mark, with stacked, supporting, human-like
      figures, also doubling up as the ‘BVA’ characters. It was important though
      for the identity not only to embolden and galvanise youth with
      disabilities, but to provide a safe and accessible environment. We
      reflected this in the identity by reimagining the default symbol of
      disability by positioning our characters in the mark and icons as heroes
      and champions in their field."
