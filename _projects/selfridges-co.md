    textOne: "## In the midst of the pandemic, we were asked by Selfridges & Co to
      create a bespoke typeface that encapsulated the word “together” - a
      much-needed virtue in and amongst uncertain times. We approached this by
      giving each character an individual stylistic approach whilst originating
      from the same structure. Our intention with the final outcome was to
      reference the beauty of diversity yet our inherent togetherness -
      regardless of appearance."
