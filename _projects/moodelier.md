    textOne: "## As a full top-to-bottom branding project, our visual concept was
      derived from the brand strategy and tone of voice, which set the core
      pillars of the identity. These pillars helped form two visual focal
      points; the first identifying Moodelier as the guide for their customers,
      helping them unleash their inner creative flair. This was reflected in the
      Logotype and Marque, which embody a guiding gesture with the Mâ€™s reaching
      flourish. The brand language and color palette draw on the second focal
      point; which identifies Moodelier as a vibrant immersive world, one can
      explore and get lost within."
