    textOne: "## We partnered with Vogue Singapore to create a bespoke typeface to
      be used across all print and digital editions from 2020-2022. The brief
      was to create something iconic and standalone, breaking the mold of a
      standardised ‘beauty’ editorial aesthetic. Our response sought to
      challenge the viewer’s perception of beauty through the creation of a
      typeface that felt flawlessly flawed - odd, yet captivating."

    textOne: "## The typeface was inspired by the national flower of Singapore, the
      Vanda orchid, with each character drawn to hold a bud-like form on its
      crossbars and tails. This was then paired with a calligraphic style that
      referenced the ancient sanskrit seen on the Singapore stone, one of
      Singapore’s oldest typographic artefacts."
