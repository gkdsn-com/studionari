    textOne: "## We were asked to create an identity for Legacy Project, Nike LA’s
      new community-focused program, run by influential female BIPOC leaders.
      The program was set up to encourage the youth of LA to lead healthier and
      more mindful lifestyles and create a tight-knit community of shared values
      and principles."

    textOne: "## **We wanted to build an identity that transmitted strength and
      togetherness from it’s core, whilst retaining a contemporary and
      aspirational essence in order for the brand to sit seamlessly within
      Nike’s portfolio. Our chosen concept was *“Fortitude”* which embodied the
      spirit of those within a tight-knit community. Semiotics of the concept
      were communicated through interlocking and supporting characters,
      constructed to feel as though they were holding each other up i.e. without
      one character the lock-up would not be able to hold its form. This
      subliminally championed the unbreakable link between leaders and their
      community.**"
