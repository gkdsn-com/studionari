      ### Nike and the Rafa Nadal Foundation partnered to create Play All, an
      innovative initiative that helps kids and young adults build confidence
      through the power of tennis, movement, and play. NARI was tasked with
      developing a visual identity for Play All that would embody Rafa Nadal’s
      four pillars: Esfuerzo (Effort), Compañerismo (Companionship),
      Deportividad (Sportsmanship), and Compromiso (Commitment).


      ### To capture the essence of these pillars, we created a playful graphic language that showcases the individuality and optimism of the young participants. Our dynamic, evolving set of mascots provides a near-infinite range of possibilities, ensuring that each child feels seen and celebrated.
