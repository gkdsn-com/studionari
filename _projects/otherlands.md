      We partnered with the founders of FLY, one of Scotland’s most
      forward-thinking music events enterprises, to create a name, strategy and
      visual identity for a brand new music and arts festival. 


      Amongst Scotland’s thriving festival scene, dance music tends to be the prevailing category, however, there is clear ‘white space’ when it comes to offerings of a more experiential nature. This is what FLY wanted to create - a festival for the ‘alternative’ listener to come and experience music and art, not just to listen and view it.
