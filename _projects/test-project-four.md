      **YOUR BUTTERFLY EFFECT - Galvanising the creative spirit through
      uncertain times**


      As one of the creative industries most esteemed institutions for championing new talent, 2021’s pandemic provided an uncharted challenge for D&AD’s New Blood Awards. We saught to create a campaign that galvanised the creative spirit through these uncertain times, reminding the viewer that one small action can catalyse a multitude of magnificent outcomes.
    textTwo: >-
      One Small Decision…We thought about the decision process of entering an
      awards ceremony for a young creative and how the current global climate
      might have increased inhibitions to do so.


      To counter this, we wanted to visualise how something small and unassuming could develop into something magnificent and multifaceted - a non-linear journey with unexpected outcomes. This provided an analogy of the step to enter the awards and the creatives journey thereafter.


      The concept was deeply rooted in the application, with each of our Butterfly Effect’s being grown at random by the rendering software. This meant none of the forms where predetermined, truly reflecting the core ethos of our concept.The concept narrative flexed as the campaign progressed, with the various butterfly effects colliding, visualising the crossing of creative paths at the festival and then exploding to signify a celebratory finale.
