    textOne: "## As one of the cornerstones of the UK dance scene, Positiva needed
      an identity that allowed them to exist in more worlds than the
      center-sticker of a vinyl record, whilst retaining the essence of their
      iconic brand. We sought to undergo a refresh that re-aligned their core
      values to a wide visual architecture, allowing them to connect with both
      long-lasting fans and new ones across all visual touchpoints."

    textOne: "## Our concept, *“Music as Medicine”* took heed from the idea of music
      having healing properties, whilst riffing off Positiva’s famous
      pharma-esque ‘plus’ symbol. This was reflected in the redrawn minimalistic
      and medicinal take on their original logotype, including the ‘plus’
      alongside as a visual motif, rather than the previous container shape. The
      visual language also took on a medicinal aesthetic, with paired back
      typography and a refreshed more vibrant take on their hallmark blue."
